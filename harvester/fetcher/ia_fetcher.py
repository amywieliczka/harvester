class IA_Fetcher(Fetcher):
    '''A fetcher for the Internet Archive.
    Put a dummy URL in harvesturl field such as 'https://example.edu'

    In the 'extra_data' field, put in the Lucene-formatted search parameters
    to return whatever body of records you want to constitute the Calisphere
    collection. For example:
        collection:environmentaldesignarchive AND subject:"edith heath"
    Will return all content with subject "edith heath" from the Environmental
    Design Archives collection. 'collection' is almost always a required field,
    as it should correspond to the institution/library we are harvesting from.
    All other metadata field searches are optional but available.
